## Lab
### Learning Outcomes
- Complete the game of life code
- Practice iterating over a 2D array
- Discover the amazing power of cellular automata

Try and complete the Game of Life we started in the class today. Here is the [code from the class](processing/lifeIncomplete).  you weren't in the class, you could take a read of the Game of Life wiki page and have a crack at implementing it from scratch yourselves. It's not too difficult. If you get your basic game of life to evolve, you could try these additions:

- The method ```void mousePressed()``` gets called in your sketch whenever the mouse is pressed. The method ```mouseDragged``` gets called whenever you hold the mouse down and move it over your sketch. You can get the mouse x and y coordinates by using the built in variables ```mouseX``` and ```mouseY```. You can use these methods to implement mouse drawing. To do this you need to calculate which row and column in the 2D array the mouse is over and then set this cell to be true.

- When you press the space key, the game should pause and unmpause, in other words, not update the game board while the game is paused
- When you press the c key, the board should clear. In otherwords, you should set every element in th 2D array to be false.
- When you press the r key, you should randomly set 50% of the elements to be true. To do this, you need to iterate through the array and generate a random number between 0.0f and 1.0f. If the number is > 0.5f, you set the element to be true otherwise set it to be false.

There some interesting starting patterns you can program also. You could write code so that when you press a number key it creates the starting pattern at the mouse x and y. I used the mouse x and y to be the top left of the shape.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|![Sketch](images/p13.png) | Gosper Gun |
|![Sketch](images/p14.png) | Lightweight spaceship |
|![Sketch](images/p15.png) | Tumbler |
|![Sketch](images/p16.png) | Glider |
|![Sketch](images/p17.png) | I'm not sure what this is called, but it makes amazing patterns |

Here is a video of what my sketch looks like:

## Lab

### Learning outcomes
- Practice iterating over arrays in Java
- Practice in using the for loop and variables to generate sequences of numbers
- Understand how a line graph is made
- Practice constructing alogorithms as part of a system
- Practice presenting data visually

Log into the slack and let me know how you are getting on today!

Use the code you wrote yesterday in the class as starter code for today's lab.
If you missed the class, [this is a link to my version](processing/arrays).

Here is what you can try and make today:

![Sketch](images/p7.png)

These are the steps I suggest you follow:

- Figure out how to draw a trend line graph first
- Then figure out how to leave horizontal and vertical borders around the graph. I would suggest making a variable called border to control this.
- Then figure out how to scale it so that it scales the data when drawing to the range 0-150. You could make this a variable
- Then figure out how to draw the horizontal axis. This will be a for loop obviously. You might find the following Java/Processing methods useful:
  - [The Processing map method](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html)
  - [textAlign](https://processing.org/reference/textAlign_.html)
  - [substring](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_string_substring.htm)
- Finally figure out how to draw the vertical axis. Another loop! This is the trickiest part I think

Try and parameterise as much of your sketch with variables, so that you could reuse the code to graph other types of data.
For example, I found it useful to write a method:

```Java
void drawAxis(float[] data, String[] horizLabels, int verticalIntervals, int maxVertical, float border)
```

to draw the horizontal and vertical axes. You might like to write seperate methods for the horizontal and vertical axis.
This took me about an hour to complete today, so it's tricky enough to get everything working, but worth it!
Take a screenshot of your sketch and [upload it to the slack](http://dt228-oop-2015.slack.com)!

### Advanced!

Try and draw this pie chart:

# Lab

## Learning outcomes

- Use variables
- Use for loops
- Use methods
- Construct an algorithm to solve a problem using sin, cos and the unit circle
- Use drawing and colours in a Processing sketch
- Use random numbers
- Be creative with code

In the lecture we learned how to make spiral shapes using a for loop with sin and cos. In the lab today you will make a sketch that draws star shapes with random numbers of points and random colours. Here is what the finished sketch could look like:

![Sketch](images/p5.png)

Here are some things you might need to read up on first:

- [random function in Processing](https://processing.org/reference/random_.html)
- [Using the modulus operator](http://www.cafeaulait.org/course/week2/15.html)

You can put all your code into the setup method as this sketch doesn't use any animation (unles you want to attempt the advanced part)

This is how I suggest you think about the problem.

- You will need a for loop that goes from 0 - TWO_PI. There will be twice as many steps as there are points on the star.
- You can use % (modulus) to decide whether the x and y values you calculate should be the tip of a point or base of the point (the pointy bit or the trough).
- Use line in your solution
- I strongly suggest you start the lab by just drawing a single star and then maybe move on to drawing multiple stars using a for loop.
- You could write a methdod to draw a single star with parameters

### Advanced
- Make a beautiful animated sketch with stars and spirals and share a picture/video/animated gif on the slack
- Use sin and cos to control colours

# Lab
## Learning Outcomes
- Use what you learned in class to build a complete game system in Processing
- Practice drawing stuff and working out relative co-ordinates
- Practice using variables and compound if statements
- Gain experience thinking computationally
- Learn how to use random numbers
- Learn how to get input from the keyboard
- Learn how to import libraries into Processing

This is a video of a game called Bugzap that you can try and make in Processing today. There is a fair bit to it, so don't worry if you don't manage to complete everything.

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/s6PA8jtWneQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6PA8jtWneQ)

How you should do it:
- Get the main game working first and then if you have time, add fonts, sound, the splash screen and the game over screen.
- Write some code to draw the bug. You can write a method to do this if you like (but it's not essential). Here is [an article on using methods in processing](https://processing.org/examples/functions.html). Also make global variables for the bug position and size.
- Get the bug moving. The bug moves a random amount either to the left or the right and it also moves down the screen. Use the random method in Processing to generate random numbers. Also the bug can't move off the screen. You can use the % operator to make something happen on an interval. For example:

  ```Java
  if (frameCount % 60 == 0)
  {
    // Code in here will happen once per second
  }
  ```
- Write some code to draw the player. Use variables to control the player position and size. A method is good here too!
- Write code to move the player in response to a key presses. This is one way to do keyboard handling in Processing:

```Java
if (keyPressed)
{
  if (keyCode == LEFT)
  {
    // This will happen if the left key is pressed
  }
}
```
- Now add the player lazer. I used to UP key for this. I just drew a line for the lazer.
- Make a variable for score and check for collisions between the lazer and the bug. Add a variable for score. You can print stuff to the screen using the text method in Processing. In my version, I actually used [this processing library](http://www.foobarquarium.de/blog/processing/MovingLetters/) which makes wireframe text.
- Make some sound effects and add them to the game. I used [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net/) to make the sounds and the Minim library to play them, but you might prefer to use the [built-in audio methods in Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/sound/).
- Add the splash screen and game over screen

Upload pictures of your creations to the Slack and do this weeks MCQ.

### Learning Outcomes
- Sign up for the class Slack
- Enroll on Webcourses
- Become familiar with the syntax of Processing
- Become familiar with writing and running sketches in Processing

Firstly, go to https://oop-2016-2017.slack.com and sign up for the slack with your DIT email address. Make sure and click *Create an account* rather than try and enter your DIT credentials at the login screen, which wont work. When you are signed up, send a little greeting to everyone on the #general channel. If you have a smartphone, you might want to install the Slack app. It's free. Also if you install the app, you will probably want to disable certain notifications, otherwise your phone will be buzzing every time someone posts anything. [Here is an article that explains how to do this](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201649323-Channel-and-group-notification-preferences).

Log onto Webcourses and enroll on the module CMPU2016.

Look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* noStroke
* noFill
* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size
* arc
* triangle

Write a processing sketch to draw the following shapes:

![Sketch](images/p1.png)

![Sketch](images/p1.1.png)

![Sketch](images/p1.2.png)

I prefer to draw the shapes on paper first before I try and work out the coordinates. Try experimenting with different colours
